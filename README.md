# Clean CNRTL

Attempt to create a more readable and more accessible version of the [dictionary](https://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/) of the _Centre National des Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales_ (CNRTL), which is one of the best dictionaries available for French but suffers from a poor and outdated presentation that greatly reduces its usefulness.

This project acts as a new front UI to the CNRTL dictionary, with the following goals:

- a **clearer presentation** for search results, clearly separating definitions, examples, citations, etc. to improve reader's understanding.
- simpler and **more semantic HTML markup**, to improve rendering from screen-readers and allow custom styling.
- a **simpler web UI**, easy to use and quick to load, focusing on the dictionary search and result.
- a **responsive design**, so the dictionary is fully usable on any type of device.
